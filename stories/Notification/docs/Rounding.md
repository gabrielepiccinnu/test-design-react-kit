The default location of the notification is in the lower right part of the window.

By using the additional fixed position classes listed below, the Notification will be positioned flush with one of the indicated margins, modifying the rounding of the corners accordingly.

NB these classes do not influence positioning on a mobile device, in this case the Notification is always at the foot of the window and occupies the entire width
